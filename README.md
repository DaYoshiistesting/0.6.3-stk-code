# SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 
SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 is a SuperTuxKart 0.6.2a fork
and was made by one man : DaYoshiistesting (me).

Then, I asked for help and P1ngvin join the 0.6.3 Team.

In October 2023, we released the latest binary version, 
that's available right here :

If you want to get older binaries you can get them right here :

In January 2024, I've decided to delete SuperTuxKart 0.6.3.
The development of SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 continued while I was out
of the project. In July 2024, I've decided to re-launch the project.
Then, I came back in the SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 Team and learned that we have
more members : DaYoshiistesting (me), P1ngvin, PeppermintPatty (leader of the
"alternative" SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 Project).

## Hardware Requirements 
* You will need a Geforce 7300LE or better (a Geforce 210 should be enough :)).
* You should have atleast a single core CPU with a frequence of 2GHz.
* You'll need at least 1024MB of RAM. 
* Ideally, if you want a joystick, get one with at least 6 buttons.

## Playing the game 
SuperTuxKart is a kart racing game. Basically you run around the track,
and give your best shot at reaching the goal before your opponents. The 
gift-boxes can help you, and nitros can build up your power-boost, 
so you can grab more than one collectable! But avoid the bananas,
since they might give you a nasty surprise.

Controls can be configured from the game.
Note that the escape key pauses the game and shows the race menu.

## 3D Coordinates
If you are looking a bit in track or karts folders, know that the SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 coordinates are reversed at some point :

Usual coordinates : X = right, Y = up, Z = forward, 
* Y/H = yaw/heading, P = pitch, R = roll.

SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 : X = right, Y = forward, Z = up, 
* Y/H = yaw/heading, P = roll, R = pitch.
