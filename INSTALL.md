SUPERTUXKART INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS :
========================================

Windows Installation Process :
------------------------------

First, make sure that you have the following packages installed/compiled :

  * Visual Studio 2008 C++ (only to execute the IDE package).
  * OpenGL (GLUT or freeGLUT/Mesa 3.0 or later).
  * PLIB v1.8.5.
  * SDL 1.2 or later (not SDL2 and after).
  * OpenAL (SDK).
  * ENet (don't get a version using an old protocol).
  * Libintl3.
  * LibVorbis.
  * LibOgg.

ALL OF THE PACKAGES ABOVE MUST BE COMPILED IN RELEASE AND WIN32 CONFIG!!

Secondly, make a folder for the includes and another one for the libraries.

Copy your includes in folders and this is what you should get in you include folder :

 * C:/yourpath/yourincludefolder/AL/yourOpenALincludes,
 * C:/yourpath/yourincludefolder/enet/yourENetincludes,
 * C:/yourpath/yourincludefolder/GL/yourOpenGLincludes,
 * C:/yourpath/yourincludefolder/ogg/yourLibOggincludes,
 * C:/yourpath/yourincludefolder/plib/yourPLIBincludes,
 * C:/yourpath/yourincludefolder/SDL/yourSDL1.2includes,
 * C:/yourpath/yourincludefolder/vorbis/yourLibVorbisincludes.

and libintl.h (this file should be in your include folder).

Copy your libraries in your libraries folder and you should get something like this :

C:/yourpath/yourlibrariesfolder/allofyourlibraries.

To get the libraries files (.lib), you will need to compile all of the packages.

Don't forget to get the binary files of your packages (.dll) to the stk folder.

Now, you will need to create 2 environment variables :

 * STK_INCLUDE
 * STK_LIB

The STK_INCLUDE variable must lead to your include folder.
The STK_LIB variable must lead to your libraries folder.

When you've done this, go to : stkfolder/src/ide/vc9 and open supertuxkart.vcproj

To compile just change the BulletDebug to BulletRelease and the game will be compiled.

Go to the stk folder and enjoy the game!

Linux Installation Process :
----------------------------

I don't know how to compile the game on modern Linux :/
I would recommend to get help on the Unofficial Discord server of SuperTuxKart :
