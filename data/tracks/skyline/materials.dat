# In this files materials with special properties are listed, along with
# the values for these properties. Only materials that are in some way
# special need to be listed here, the others will use the default values.
#
# Here is an explanation of what each property do and their default values,
# the actual properties are at the bottom of the file:
#
# UVClamp
# -----
# Clamp texture border instead of repeating the texture. This has
# two values, one for the X-axis and another for the Y-axis, which can be
# Y or N (yes or no).
#
# To understand what clamping is, hre is an example with my poor ASCII art:
#
#                                                          ox
# Suppose you have a 2x2 texture which represented here by xo , where o is a
# black square and x is a white square. If you place the texture in a 4x4
# grid, you would think you get this:
# 
# ....
# ....
# ox..
# xo..
#
# Where the . are empty spaces.
# 
# However, what really happens is that by default the texture repeats itself:
#
# oxox
# xoxo
# oxox
# xoxo
#
# But if you clamp the texture on both the X and the Y axis you get this:
#
# oxoo
# oxoo
# oxxx
# xooo
#
# So only the borders repeat in the X and Y direction, not the whole texture.
#
#
# Translucency
# ------------
# Use the alpha value of the texture to produce translucent areas. Can be
# Y or N, default is N.
#
#
# Alpha reference
# ---------------
# This value is used for the alpha test, which is to compare all the
# alpha values of the pixels of the texture against the alpha refence, and
# if the test succeeds, the pixel is not drawn. Values go from 0.0 to 1.0.
# 1.0 that no pixels are drawn, 0.0 means that only pixels completely
# translucent are not drawn. Default is 0.1.
#
#
# Lighting
# --------
# Let lights affect how dark or light a texture is. Can be Y or N, default is
# Y.
#
# 
# Sphere map
# ----------
# Place the texture as if it is on top of a reflective sphere. This is useful
# on shiny metal objects, for example the coins. Can be Y or N, default is
# N.
#
#
# Friction
# --------
# How much friction there is between an object with this texture and the
# wheels of the kart. Obviously, is only useful if a kart will ever be
# standing on top of an object with this texture. The smaller this value is,
# the more slippery a surface is. Values should go from 1.0 to 0.1, where
# 1.0 is the friction of the road. Default is 1.0 .
#
# At the moment, friction only limits the speed and acceleration of the karts.
#
#
#
# Ignore
# ------
# Don't crash with a surface that has this texture applied. Values can be Y or
# N. Default is N.
#
#
# Zipper
# ------
# Karts get a speed boost when they touch a surface with this texture. Values
# can be Y or N. Default is N.
#
#
# Resetter
# --------
# When a kart touches this surface, it is rescued, useful for lava and others.
# Values can be Y or N. Default value is N.
#
#
# Collide
# -------
# When you crash against a surface with this texture, the kart will not
# continue moving, instead it will stop the kart dead. Values can be Y or N,
# default value is Y.
