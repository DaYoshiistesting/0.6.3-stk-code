* You'll need at least 128Mb RAM. 
* A sound card would be nice - but it's not essential.
* Ideally, you want a joystick with at least 6 buttons.

PLAYING THE GAME
================
SuperTuxKart is a kart racing game. Basically you run around the track,
and give your best shot at reaching the goal before your opponents. The ?
boxes can help you, and collection coins can build up your power, so you can
grab more than one collectable! But avoid the bananas, since they might
give you a nasty surprise.
