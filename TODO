Things that would be nice to fix, but are not urgent
=====================================================
- Write some documentation.
- Display skid marks again (currently disabled due to problems of 
  skid marks being 'in the air').
- Added settings menu (e.g. for MPH vs KPH (vs. KM/H), ...)
- Add a tutorial course
- Valgrind for memory bugs.
- Update the web page, make more screen shots, ...
- Tight/wide corner steering for AI. The AI is hitting the wall
  in very tight corners (e.g. subseatrack) [coz]


long term
=========
- Add network multiplayer
- Make full use of OpenAL
- Performance tuning
  - Support for multi-core CPUs
    (while this is not strictly necessary, it might be a nice headline
    for news entries. The physics/collision detection would be
    easy to parallelise)
- More gadgets
  - Positive: - squirt oil on track to make karts slip, ...
  - Negative: - 'dirt on windscreen' - partial blackout of screen
- More flexibility for items. E.g. 
  - Tracks might hard code some items, change the distribution of some
    others (e.g. only a rocket at a certain location, but random choice
    which one the kart gets. Instead of just specifying 
    GREENHERRING, one could write: ZIPPER:ANVIL and one of the listed
    things would be picked randomly)
  - Grand prixs might want to overwrite this, e.g.:
    "war" grand prix: only rockets for all gadgets
  - Perhaps make good and bad things indistinguishable?
- sound/music manager needed
  Make it easy to replace sounds (which are currently hardcoded), e.g
  via a config file. Sound/music should be selectable for a track,
  but a grand prix should be able to overwrite this to create a consistent
  ambience, ...
- More tracks
- More grand prixs
- Code cleanup
