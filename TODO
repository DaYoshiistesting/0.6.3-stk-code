Things that would be nice to fix/do for the project :
=====================================================
- Write some documentation.
- Display skid marks again (currently disabled due to problems of 
  skid marks being 'in the air').
- Added settings menu (e.g. for MPH vs KPH (vs. KM/H), ...)
- Valgrind for memory bugs.
- Make a web page, make more screen shots, ...
- Tight/wide corner steering for AI. The AI is hitting the wall
  in very tight corners (e.g. subseatrack) [coz]
- Add network multiplayer.
- Performance tuning.
  - Support for multi-core CPUs
    (while this is not strictly necessary, it might be a nice headline
    for news entries. The physics/collision detection would be
    easy to parallelise)
- Make a smarter AI for hard difficulty.
  - Make AI go to items and avoid wrong items.
- Code cleanup.
