SUPERTUXKART INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

General
-------

First, make sure that you have the following packages installed:

  * OpenGL (or Mesa 3.0 or later)
  * PLIB version 1.8.4 or later
  * SDL 1.2 or later
  * OpenAL

Unpack the files from the tarball like this:

  tar xzf supertuxkart-*.tar.gz
  cd supertuxkart-*


where '*' is the version of SuperTuxkart you downloaded - eg 0.2.0. Then:

  ./configure
  make

To test the compilation, supertuxkart can be run from the build
directory by ./src/supertuxkart  (./src/supertuxkart.exe on windows).

To install the file, as root execute:

  make install

The default install location is /usr/local, i.e. the data files will
be written to /usr/local/share/games/supertuxkart, the executable
will be copied to /usr/local/bin. To change the default installation
location, use the "--prefix" option of configure, e.g. --prefix=/usr
See the --help output of configure for further options.


SVN STK on Ubuntu Edgy
----------------------
Here are the compilation instructions for the current svn(05 oct. 2006) of
Super Tux Kart on Ubuntu Edgy, contributed by Damien:

install following packages:
# apt-get install libopenal-dev libmikmod2-dev plib1.8.4-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev subversion autoconf automake1.9 g++ gcc

do a:
$ svn checkout http://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/trunk/supertuxkart

then:
$ cd trunk
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
and if all went well:
$ src/supertuxkart

tested with g++ 3.3 and 4.1 , both succeeded.

If you want to install the game system-wide, do 'make install'.


But it didn't work!
-------------------

If you checked out your copy directly from SVN, you have to run
'sh autogen.sh' to generate the configure script.

You should check the SuperTuxKart wiki at:

http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/


Also, the most common (by FAR) reason for problems is that your OpenGL/Mesa
is incorrectly installed - so before you complain to any of the PLIB or
Supertuxkart mailing lists, first try running one of the example programs
that comes with your OpenGL implementation - or one of the Mesa or GLUT
sample programs.

If you those examples run OK - then go to the PLIB home page and download
the PLIB examples.

If THOSE run correctly - but Supertuxkart doesn't then please get in touch 
with the SupertuxKart mailing list and we'll do our best to get you up and 
racing.
